\title{Make a rooted binary IQ-TREE by splitting the outgroup branch equally}
\usage{
make_binary_iqtree(tre_path, out_lbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{tre_path}{Character, path to the input Newick tree file.}

\item{out_lbl}{Character, the exact outgroup tip label to split on.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the output file path; writes a
\verb{*.bi.treefile} next to the input file.
}
\description{
Read a Newick tree file produced by IQ-TREE, locate an outgroup tip by its
label, extract its pendant branch length \code{L}, remove the original occurrence,
and output a new binary tree \verb{(<ingroup>:L/2,<outgroup>:L/2);}.
}
\details{
This function expects the outgroup label to be present exactly once and its
pendant branch length to be of the form \verb{:0.xxx}. The removal tries both
\verb{,label:L} and \verb{label:L,}. If neither matches, it errors with a diagnostic.
